- `episode`: Contains queries and outputs for fetching episode data from the Rick and Morty API.

## Tasks Overview

### 0. Write a Query to Get a Specific Character by ID

### 1. Write a Query to Get a List of All Characters
- Paginated queries and outputs for character lists (pages 1–4).

### 2. Write a Query to Get a Specific Episode by ID
